# Google Analytics anomalies monitor

Application allows detection of anomalies in Google Analytics data based on custom events. Forecast data is calculated using [Holt's linear trend method](https://www.otexts.org/fpp/7/2) ([exponential smoothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing)). Here is code base which provides API to calculate and manage data. Check out [client application](https://github.com/fraszczakszymon/ga-anomalies-monitor-client) which is UI for **Google Analytics anomalies monitor**.

4. Go to [management of service accounts](https://console.developers.google.com/permissions/serviceaccounts) and create a new service account with a private key (type: p12),
5. Save automatically downloaded .p12 file in _config/key.p12_,
6. Create _config/key.pem_ file using command:

        cat config/key.p12 | openssl pkcs12 -nodes -nocerts -passin pass:notasecret | openssl rsa > config/key.pem
